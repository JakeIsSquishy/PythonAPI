<b>Problems:</b>
I have 'completed' this api, however I have run into a problem. 

The problem I face is that I cannot seem to access the port that I 
thought I had locally opened while using the same machine.

While this code compiles and the docker image successfully builds,
I am unsure if the gets/posts/deletes are actually working.

<b>What I've learned:</b>
The primary takeaway is that I now know more about API structure. 
I have worked on making an API in C# for coursework, so it was 
interesting getting a feel for how it worked in another language.

I also learned the basics of using Docker. Since it is a tool that
allows large amounts of flexibility in one's scalability, I am glad 
that I have gained some experience with it.

<b>Update:</b>
I have found a way to access my api. I needed to call
'docker-machine ls' to see the IP for the docker container and am 
now able to see my README.md file on my browser.
